Okay, I understand. I will go through the "Development Roadmap" (Section 3) of the SRS document you provided and add the "üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**" points immediately after each `**Cursor AI Prompt:**` block. These checks will be designed to guide the human user in testing and verifying the AI's output, supporting the educational goal.

Here is the updated SRS document with the "üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**" additions:

---

```markdown
Act as an experienced Laravel educator and technical writer. Your task is to generate a comprehensive, highly readable, and easily navigable Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a tutorial project called "Ghodo School Admin Panel (ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿ∫ÿØŸà - ŸÑŸàÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ)".

This SRS is specifically designed for a beginner Laravel developer who will leverage an AI coding assistant, specifically Cursor AI, for code generation. The document must be formatted in Markdown, optimized for viewing and navigation within VS Code, particularly with the "Markdown All in One" extension installed, ensuring robust internal linking from the Table of Contents to sections and from sections back to the top/TOC where possible using standard Markdown practices.

The primary goal of this SRS is **educational**: it must guide the beginner through building the application using Laravel 12, AdminLTE 3+, and MySQL 8+, deeply explaining core concepts and Laravel best practices. It should empower them to understand the 'what' and 'why', enabling them to effectively prompt Cursor AI for the 'how' (code).

**This document structure is designed with the following features:**

*   A clear Software Requirements Specification (SRS) format.
*   A detailed Development Roadmap (Section 3) that breaks down the project into manageable phases and individual tasks.
*   **Inline, Sub-numbered, Structured Cursor AI Prompts** placed directly below the specific tasks in the Development Roadmap (Section 3). These prompts are formatted as clear, bulleted lists of instructions designed to be copied and pasted into Cursor AI.
*   Each structured inline Cursor AI prompt concludes with a specific request for the AI to suggest alternative or more standard Laravel practices and explain the reasoning.
*   **Inline "Developer Check" points** placed directly after each Cursor AI prompt in Section 3 to guide the user in verifying the AI-generated code.
*   Instructions for the developer to add a checkmark (‚úÖ) at the beginning of each task in the Development Roadmap as they complete it.

**Project Details:**
- Name: Ghodo School Admin Panel (ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿ∫ÿØŸà - ŸÑŸàÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ)
- Recommended Laravel Project/Repo Name: `ghodo-school-admin`
- Stack: Laravel 12, AdminLTE 3+ (with Vite), MySQL 8+
- UI: Arabic language, RTL layout. Use Laravel Localization (`lang` files).

**Core Functionality:**
- Authentication: Login/Logout (Recommend Laravel Breeze).
- Authorization: Two roles (`admin`, `staff`) with permissions enforced using Laravel Policies and Middleware.
- Dashboard: Role-specific overview widgets.
- User Management: CRUD operations for Admin users, accessible only by Admins (use `IsAdmin` middleware).
- Maintenance Requests: CRUD operations, accessible by both roles but with different permissions. Enforce via `MaintenanceRequestPolicy`.
- Material Requests: CRUD operations, similar role-based permissions enforced via `MaterialRequestPolicy`.

**SRS Content & Structure Requirements:**
1.  **Table of Contents (TOC):** Provide instructions for generating the TOC at the beginning using "Markdown All in One." The main document headings must be structured clearly (`#`, `##`, `###`) for the extension to parse.
2.  **Standard SRS Sections:** Include Introduction, Overall Description, Functional Requirements, Data Model, Use Cases, Workflows, **Detailed Development Roadmap**, and Non-Functional Requirements.
3.  **Deep Educational Focus:** Explain Laravel concepts and best practices with rationale. Use beginner-friendly language. Mention `php artisan` commands. Include "Key Learning Takeaway" boxes.
4.  **Cursor AI Integration Advice:** Include "Tips for Prompting Cursor AI" sections where appropriate, alongside the inline prompts in the roadmap.
5.  **Laravel Best Practices:** Mandate and explain Laravel 12 conventions.
6.  **Data Model Clarity:** Define migrations/tables, Eloquent relationships, `$fillable`.
7.  **Authorization Detail:** Explicitly detail Policies and Middleware usage.
8.  **Hints for Advanced Features:** Suggest potential "next steps" for continued learning.
9.  **Readability & Parsability:** Use enhanced Markdown (bolding, lists, visual separators) for clarity, scannability, and to be easily parsed by AI.
10. **Linking:** Ensure headings use standard Markdown for reliable TOC generation. Add `[Back to Top](#)` links at the end of major H2 sections.
11. **Constraint:** Do **NOT** output any source code *outside* of the example markdown structure and the generated SRS content. The SRS itself should focus on requirements, explanations, and prompts, not the final application code.

Produce a document that is exceptionally well-organized, educational, and directly usable by a beginner Laravel developer in conjunction with Cursor AI, ensuring the Markdown structure facilitates excellent internal navigation within VS Code.

## 3. Development Roadmap (Learning Path)

This roadmap suggests a structured approach to developing the project, focusing on learning core Laravel concepts progressively. Each step builds upon the previous ones. Add a checkmark (‚úÖ) next to each task once you complete it.

### 3.1. Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment
0.1.  ‚úÖ **Install Laravel 12:** Use the command `composer create-project laravel/laravel ghodo-school-admin "12.*"`.
0.2.  ‚úÖ **Configure `.env**:** Set up `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`, and your database connection details (`DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`). Ensure you create the database in your MySQL client.
    **Cursor AI Prompt:**
    - Guide me on how to configure the `.env` file for a MySQL database named 'ghodo_admin_db'.
    - Provide the specific lines to modify.
    - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
    üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
    - Open your `.env` file.
    - Verify that `APP_NAME` is set to "Ghodo School Admin Panel".
    - Verify that `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` match your local MySQL setup.
    - Try running `php artisan config:cache` and then `php artisan config:clear`. If there's a syntax error in `.env`, these might fail.
0.3.  ‚úÖ **Initial Migration:** Run `php artisan migrate` to create the default Laravel tables.
    **Cursor AI Prompt:**
    - Confirm the Artisan command to run initial database migrations.
    - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
    üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
    - Connect to your MySQL database using a client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, TablePlus, DBeaver).
    - Verify that the database `ghodo_admin_db` (or your chosen name) now contains tables like `users`, `password_reset_tokens`, `migrations`, etc.
0.4.  ‚úÖ **Install Laravel Breeze:** Execute `php artisan breeze:install`. When prompted, select the "Blade with Alpine" stack (or your preference, but Blade is assumed for this SRS). Then run `npm install && npm run dev`. Verify that basic login and registration pages work (e.g., `/login`, `/register`).
    **Cursor AI Prompt:**
    - Show me the complete sequence of Artisan and npm commands required to install Laravel Breeze using the Blade stack and prepare the frontend assets.
    - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
    üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
    - After running the commands, visit `/login` and `/register` in your browser.
    - Ensure the pages load correctly and basic Breeze styling is applied.
    - Try registering a new user and logging in/out.
    *   **Learning:** Laravel project installation, environment configuration (`.env`), database setup, initial migrations, and understanding Laravel's starter kits like Breeze for authentication scaffolding.

---

### 3.2. Phase 1: Authentication & Basic Layout
1.1.  **AdminLTE Integration:**
    *   4.1.1.1. ‚úÖ **Download AdminLTE 3+ assets:** Place them in your `resources/` directory (e.g., `resources/backend/adminlte/`). (Manual Step)
    *   4.1.1.2. ‚úÖ **Configure Laravel Vite:** Update `vite.config.js` to compile these AdminLTE assets and your custom `app.css` / `app.js` for the backend.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Update the `vite.config.js` file to compile AdminLTE CSS (`adminlte.min.css`) and JS (`adminlte.min.js`) from `resources/backend/adminlte/dist/` along with my custom `resources/css/app_admin.css` and `resources/js/app_admin.js`.
        - Ensure the output directory is `public/build/`.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.
        - Check your `public/build/assets` directory (or similar, depending on Vite's manifest output). You should see compiled versions of AdminLTE assets and your custom CSS/JS.
        - Ensure there are no compilation errors in the terminal.
    *   4.1.1.3. ‚úÖ **Create main AdminLTE layout:** Create `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`. This layout should include the AdminLTE header, footer, and a basic **RTL sidebar** structure. Use `@yield('content')` for the main page content.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Generate the code for a basic Blade layout file at `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`.
        - It should include the fundamental AdminLTE structure (HTML tag with RTL attributes, body, wrapper, header, sidebar, content wrapper with `@yield('content')`, footer).
        - Include `@vite` directives for the assets defined in `vite.config.js`.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Create a simple test route that returns a view extending `layouts.admin` with some basic content in the `@section('content')`.
        - Visit this route in your browser. You should see the AdminLTE layout (header, sidebar, footer) with your content.
        - Check the browser's developer console for any errors related to missing CSS/JS.
    *   4.1.1.4. ‚úÖ **Adapt Breeze views:** Modify the authentication views generated by Breeze (e.g., `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`) to `@extends('layouts.admin')` and place their form content within the AdminLTE structure.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Modify the Breeze login view located at `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` to extend the `layouts.admin` layout.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        (Repeat for other Breeze views like `register.blade.php` as needed).
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Visit the `/login` and `/register` pages.
        - They should now display within your AdminLTE layout instead of the default Breeze layout.
        - Ensure forms are still functional.
1.2.  **Localization Setup:**
    *   1.2.1. ‚úÖ **Set default locale:** Set the default locale to `ar` in `config/app.php` (`'locale' => 'ar', 'fallback_locale' => 'en',`). (Manual Configuration)
    *   1.2.2. ‚úÖ **Create Arabic translation files:** Create necessary files in `lang/ar/` (e.g., `auth.php`, `validation.php`, `pagination.php`, and a custom `messages.php`).
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Create the standard Laravel Arabic language files in the `lang/ar/` directory.
        - Include `auth.php`, `validation.php`, `pagination.php`, and an empty `messages.php` file.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Verify the `lang/ar` directory exists and contains the specified files.
        - Open `auth.php` and see if it has some default Arabic translations (Laravel ships with some).
    *   1.2.3. ‚úÖ **Translate user-facing text:** Translate all user-facing text in the Breeze authentication views and your AdminLTE layout using `__('file.key')` or `@lang('file.key')`. (Manual Translation/Replacement)
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Provide an example of how to use the `__` helper to translate a simple phrase like 'Dashboard' or 'Login' in a Blade view, assuming the translation key exists in `lang/ar/messages.php`.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Add a sample translation like `'Login' => 'ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØÿÆŸàŸÑ'` to `lang/ar/messages.php`.
        - Use `__('messages.Login')` in your `login.blade.php` view for the login button or heading.
        - Visit the login page. It should display "ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØÿÆŸàŸÑ".
    *   1.2.4. ‚úÖ **Ensure RTL HTML tag:** Ensure the main HTML tag in `layouts/admin.blade.php` has `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`. (Part of Layout Creation)
    *   **Learning:** Frontend asset management with Vite, creating and using Blade layouts (`@extends`, `@section`, `@yield`), integrating a third-party admin template, implementing Laravel Localization for a non-English UI, and configuring RTL layout.

---

### 3.3. Phase 2: User (Admin) Management - Full CRUD & Authorization
*This is a critical phase for understanding core Laravel patterns.*
2.1.  **Data Model Update:**
    *   2.1.1. ‚úÖ **Modify users migration:** Add `phone` (string, nullable), `civil_id` (string, nullable), and `role` (ENUM('admin', 'staff') with a default of 'staff') to the existing `create_users_table` migration (or a new one).
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Generate the code needed to add nullable string columns `phone` and `civil_id`, and an ENUM column `role` ('admin', 'staff' with 'staff' as default) to the `users` table migration file.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open the latest `users` table migration file.
        - Verify the new columns (`phone`, `civil_id`, `role`) are defined correctly with their types and constraints.
    *   2.1.2. ‚úÖ **Run migration:** Run `php artisan migrate` (or `php artisan migrate:fresh` if you want to reset the DB). (Command)
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:** (After running migration)
        - Check your `users` table schema in your database client.
        - Confirm the new `phone`, `civil_id`, and `role` columns exist.
    *   2.1.3. ‚úÖ **Update User model:** Add `phone`, `civil_id`, `role` to the `$fillable` array. Create an `isAdmin()` helper method: `public function isAdmin(): bool { return $this->role === 'admin'; }`.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `App\Models\User` model, update the `$fillable` array to include `phone`, `civil_id`, and `role`.
        - Add a public method `isAdmin()` that returns a boolean based on whether the user's `role` is 'admin'.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open `app/Models/User.php`.
        - Verify `$fillable` includes the new fields.
        - Verify the `isAdmin()` method is present and correctly checks `this->role === 'admin'`.
2.2.  **Seeding:**
    *   2.2.1. ‚úÖ **Create UserSeeder:** Use `php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder`. (Command)
    *   2.2.2. ‚úÖ **Implement UserSeeder:** In the seeder's `run()` method, create at least one admin user (e.g., `User::create([... 'role' => 'admin', ...])`).
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `UserSeeder` class, write the `run` method to create one user with role 'admin' and password 'password', and one user with role 'staff' and password 'password'.
        - Ensure passwords are hashed using `Hash::make()`.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php`.
        - Review the `run()` method logic. Ensure it uses `User::create()` or `DB::table('users')->insert()` and hashes passwords.
    *   2.2.3. ‚úÖ **Call Seeder from DatabaseSeeder:** Update `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` to call `UserSeeder`. (Manual Code Addition)
    *   2.2.4. ‚úÖ **Run seeder:** Run `php artisan db:seed` (or `migrate:fresh --seed`). (Command)
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:** (After running seeder)
        - Check the `users` table in your database.
        - Verify that the admin and staff users have been created with the correct roles.
2.3.  **Routing:**
    *   2.3.1. ‚úÖ **Define admin route group:** Define a route group in `routes/web.php` for admin functionalities, including the resourceful route for 'users' and applying the `is_admin` middleware.
        ```php
        Route::middleware(['auth'])->prefix('admin')->name('admin.')->group(function () {
            // Dashboard route
            Route::get('/dashboard', function() {
                return view('admin.dashboard');
            })->name('dashboard');

            // User management routes
            Route::resource('users', App\Http\Controllers\Admin\UserController::class)->middleware('is_admin');
            // Other admin resource routes will also go in this group
        });
        ```
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In `routes/web.php`, define a route group using `Route::middleware(['auth'])->prefix('admin')->name('admin.')->group(...)`.
        - Inside this group, define a resourceful route for 'users' managed by `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\UserController`.
        - Apply the `is_admin` middleware to the 'users' resource route.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open `routes/web.php`.
        - Verify the route group and the `Route::resource('users', ...)` are correctly defined with the specified middleware and naming.
        - Run `php artisan route:list` in your terminal and look for routes prefixed with `admin/users` (e.g., `admin.users.index`, `admin.users.create`).
2.4.  **Middleware for Admin Access:**
    *   2.4.1. ‚úÖ **Create IsAdmin middleware:** Use `php artisan make:middleware IsAdmin`. (Command)
    *   2.4.2. ‚úÖ **Implement IsAdmin middleware:** Implement its `handle` method to check if the authenticated user exists and if `auth()->user()->isAdmin()` is true. If the check fails, return an `abort(403)`.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `IsAdmin` middleware's `handle` method, write the logic to check if the authenticated user exists and if `auth()->user()->isAdmin()` is true.
        - If the check fails, return an `abort(403)` response.
        - Otherwise, call `$next($request)` to allow the request to proceed.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open `app/Http/Middleware/IsAdmin.php`.
        - Review the `handle` method. Ensure it correctly checks for an authenticated admin user and aborts with 403 if not.
    *   2.4.3. ‚úÖ **Register IsAdmin middleware:** Register this middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php` under `$routeMiddleware` (e.g., `'is_admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\IsAdmin::class`).
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In `app/Http/Kernel.php`, register the `App\Http\Middleware\IsAdmin` middleware with the alias `is_admin` in the `$routeMiddleware` array.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
        - Verify that `'is_admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\IsAdmin::class,` is present in the `$routeMiddleware` array.
    *   2.4.4. ‚úÖ **Apply middleware to route:** This was part of the routing step above.
2.5.  **Controller:**
    *   2.5.1. ‚úÖ **Create UserController:** Use `php artisan make:controller Admin/UserController --resource --model=User`. (Command)

        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `Admin\DashboardController@index` method, check if the authenticated user (`auth()->user()`) is admin using the `isAdmin()` helper method.
        - If the user is admin, fetch counts for: total users (`App\Models\User::count()`), total pending maintenance requests (status 'new' or 'in_progress' from `App\Models\MaintenanceRequest`), and total pending material requests (status 'pending' from `App\Models\MaterialRequest`). (Ensure these models exist or stub them).
        - If the user is staff (`!auth()->user()->isAdmin()`), fetch counts for: their own pending maintenance requests (created by `auth()->id()`, status 'new' or 'in_progress'), and their own pending material requests (created by `auth()->id()`, status 'pending'). Use Eloquent queries with `where('requester_id', auth()->id())` and appropriate status conditions.
        - Pass these fetched counts to the `admin.dashboard` view using an associative array (e.g., `compact('usersCount', 'pendingMaintenanceCount', ...)`).

        - The form should submit via POST to the material request update route (`route('admin.material-requests.update', $materialRequest)`) and include `@csrf`, and use `@method('PUT')`.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:** (After controller `edit` method is implemented)
        - As admin, edit a material request. Verify pre-fill and dropdowns.
        - As staff, edit *their own 'pending'* material request. Verify pre-fill, dropdowns, and editable fields.
        - As staff, try to edit their *own 'approved'* request. Verify fields are disabled/form non-submittable based on policy.
    *   5.4. ‚òê **Create show view:** (Optional) Display full request details.
    *   5.5. ‚òê **Implement Controller methods:** Implement `index`, `create`, `store`, `edit`, `update`, and `destroy` methods using Form Requests, `$this->authorize()`, Eloquent, eager loading, and redirects with flash messages. Ensure 'store' sets `requester_id`, and 'create'/'edit' fetch open maintenance requests for the dropdown.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In `Admin\MaterialRequestController`, implement the `index()` method. Authorize `viewAny`. Fetch material requests, eager load `requester` and `maintenanceRequest` relationships, and paginate results (`paginate(15)`). Pass results to the `index` view.
        - Implement the `create()` method. Authorize `create`. Fetch *open* maintenance requests (status 'new' or 'in_progress') to populate the dropdown in the form. Pass these open requests to the `create` view under a variable name like `$openMaintenanceRequests`.
        - Implement the `store()` method. Type-hint `StoreMaterialRequestRequest`. Authorization is handled by the Form Request. Create the material request using validated data, manually setting `requester_id` to `auth()->id()`. Redirect to the index route with a success flash message.
        - Implement the `show(MaterialRequest $materialRequest)` method. Authorize `view` for the `$materialRequest` instance. Eager load `requester` and `maintenanceRequest` relationships on `$materialRequest`. Return the `show` view (if created), passing the `$materialRequest`.
        - Implement the `edit(MaterialRequest $materialRequest)` method. Authorize `update` for the `$materialRequest` instance. Fetch *open* maintenance requests to populate the dropdown in the form. Pass the `$materialRequest` and the list of `$openMaintenanceRequests` to the `edit` view.
        - Implement the `update(UpdateMaterialRequestRequest $request, MaterialRequest $materialRequest)` method. Authorization is handled by the Form Request. Update the `$materialRequest` instance with validated data. Redirect to the index route with a success flash message.
        - Implement the `destroy(MaterialRequest $materialRequest)` method. Authorize `delete` for the `$materialRequest` instance. Delete the request. Redirect to the index route with a success flash message.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - **Index/Create/Store/Edit/Update/Destroy:** Perform similar checks as for Maintenance Requests, ensuring the `maintenance_request_id` linkage works, dropdowns are populated, and policies are enforced for staff (e.g., can only edit 'pending' requests).
6.  ‚òê **Add Sidebar Link:** Add link to `route('admin.material-requests.index')` in the AdminLTE sidebar.
    **Cursor AI Prompt:**
    - In the AdminLTE sidebar Blade file, add a navigation link for 'Material Requests'.
    - Point this link to `route('admin.material-requests.index')`.
    - This link should be visible to both 'admin' and 'staff' roles.
    - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
    üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
    - Log in as admin/staff. Verify "Material Requests" link is visible and functional.
    *   **Key Learning Takeaway:** Reinforcing the advanced authorization patterns, working with optional foreign key relationships, and building complex forms with dynamic data (dropdown for related requests).
7.  **Create Material Request Tests:** Implement unit and feature tests.
    *   7.1. ‚òê **Create MaterialRequestModelTest:** Test model relationships and attributes.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Create a `MaterialRequestModelTest.php` file in the `tests/Unit/` directory.
        - Test that the `MaterialRequest` model correctly defines its relationships: `requester()` (belongsTo User) and `maintenanceRequest()` (belongsTo MaintenanceRequest).
        - Test that all required attributes (requester_id, maintenance_request_id, item_description, quantity, cost, funding_source, status) are fillable.
        - Verify that the model correctly handles nullable relationships (maintenanceRequest can be null).
        - Use the `RefreshDatabase` trait and create test models to verify relationship loading.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Run `php artisan test tests/Unit/MaterialRequestModelTest.php`. Ensure tests pass.
    *   7.2. ‚òê **Create MaterialRequestTest:** Test CRUD operations and permissions.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Create a `MaterialRequestTest.php` file in the `tests/Feature/` directory.
        - Test CRUD operations: both admin and staff can create requests, view request lists (with proper filtering), and update requests.
        - Test permission rules: staff can only edit their own 'pending' requests, only admin can delete requests.
        - Test that material requests can be optionally linked to maintenance requests and that the relationship works correctly.
        - Test that the material request's requester_id is set to the authenticated user when created.
        - Use the `RefreshDatabase` trait and set up test users, maintenance requests, and material requests in the setUp method.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Run `php artisan test tests/Feature/MaterialRequestTest.php`. Ensure all feature tests pass.
    *   **Key Learning Takeaway:** Reinforcing the advanced authorization patterns, working with optional foreign key relationships, and building complex forms with dynamic data (dropdown for related requests).

### 3.7. Phase 6: Refinements & Next Steps
1.  ‚òê **Review Dashboard Data:** Ensure all dashboard widgets are fetching and displaying correct, live data based on the implemented modules and user roles. (Refinement of Phase 3 Logic)
2.  **Eager Loading Review:** Go through all controller `index` and `show` methods (and any other places where related models are accessed in loops). Implement eager loading using `->with(['relationshipName', 'otherRelationship'])` where appropriate to prevent N+1 query problems. Use Laravel Debugbar (see Non-Functional Requirements) to verify query counts.
    *   2.1. ‚òê **Maintenance Requests:**
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `Admin\MaintenanceRequestController@index` method, modify the Eloquent query to ensure the `requester` relationship is eager loaded using `->with('requester')` when fetching maintenance requests.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Install Laravel Debugbar (`composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev`).
        - Visit the maintenance requests index page. Check the "Queries" tab in Debugbar. Note the number of queries.
        - If you were previously looping through requests and accessing `$request->requester->name` without eager loading, you should see a reduction in queries after implementing `->with('requester')`.
    *   2.2. ‚òê **Material Requests:**
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `Admin\MaterialRequestController@index` method, modify the Eloquent query to ensure the `requester` and `maintenanceRequest` relationships are eager loaded using `->with(['requester', 'maintenanceRequest'])` when fetching material requests.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Visit the material requests index page.
        - Use Laravel Debugbar to verify that eager loading for `requester` and `maintenanceRequest` has reduced the number of database queries compared to not using `->with()`.
3.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    *   3.1. ‚òê **Arabic Labels:** Ensure all forms have clear Arabic labels from localization files. (Manual task using `__('...')`)
    *   3.2. ‚òê **Flash Messages:** Implement consistent flash messages (e.g., using `session()->flash('success', 'Message')`) for create, update, delete actions, and display them in your `layouts.admin` Blade file.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - In the `layouts/admin.blade.php` file, add Blade code within the main content area (e.g., right below the header or content-header) to check for and display success, error, or warning flash messages stored in the session using keys like `success`, `error`, `warning`.
        - Use AdminLTE alert styles for displaying these messages (e.g., `alert alert-success`, `alert alert-danger`, `alert alert-warning`).
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Perform a CRUD action (e.g., create a user). Verify the appropriate flash message (success, error) is displayed correctly with AdminLTE styling.
        - Check all CRUD actions across modules for consistent flash message display.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Provide an example of how to redirect back to a list page (e.g., `route('admin.users.index')`) after a successful form submission in a Laravel controller's `store` or `update` method.
        - Show how to attach a success flash message (e.g., 'User created successfully!') to the session during the redirect using the `with()` method on the redirect response.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Review a `store` or `update` method in one of your controllers (e.g., `UserController`).
        - Ensure it uses `redirect()->route(...)->with('success', 'Your message');` or similar.
    *   3.3. ‚òê **Styling Check:** Check for consistent styling and responsive behavior. (Manual Testing/CSS)
4.  ‚òê **Comprehensive Testing:** Log in as different user roles and test every feature and permission boundary. (Manual Task)
    *   4.1. ‚òê **Run all unit and feature tests:** Execute the full test suite with `php artisan test` and fix any failures.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Execute all tests using `php artisan test` command.
        - Review any failing tests and fix the underlying issues.
        - Focus on edge cases where authorization rules might not be properly enforced.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - After running `php artisan test`, ensure the output shows all tests passing.
        - If any tests fail, debug the relevant code and test logic until they pass.
    *   4.2. ‚òê **Generate and review test coverage reports:** Configure PHPUnit to generate coverage reports to identify untested code.
        **Cursor AI Prompt:**
        - Update your `phpunit.xml` file to enable code coverage reporting (e.g., add `<coverage processUncoveredFiles="true"><include><directory suffix=".php">./app</directory></include><report><html outputDirectory="build/coverage"/></report></coverage>`).
        - Generate a coverage report using `php artisan test --coverage`. (You might need Xdebug installed and configured for PHP).
        - Identify areas of the application with low test coverage and add additional tests to cover those areas.
        - Could you suggest any alternative or more standard Laravel practices for this specific task/code block, and explain why they might be better?
        üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Check:**
        - Open the generated HTML coverage report (e.g., in `build/coverage/index.html`).
        - Review the coverage percentages for your controllers, models, policies, etc.
        - Identify any critical logic that is not covered by tests.
5.  ‚òê **Code Review & Refactoring (Self-Review):** Review code for cleanliness, repetition, and adherence to standards. (Manual Task)
    *   Read through your code. Is it clean and understandable?
    *   Are there any repetitive code blocks that could be refactored into helper methods or Blade components?
    *   Is the naming of variables, methods, and routes consistent and meaningful?
    *   **Learning:** Optimizing application performance with eager loading, improving user experience with feedback (flash messages), the importance of thorough testing across different user roles, and basic code refactoring principles.
    *   **Hints for Advanced Features (Post-Project Learning):**
        *   **File Uploads:** Allow users to attach images or documents to Maintenance Requests.
        *   **Notifications:** Send email notifications when a request status changes.
        *   **Reporting:** Generate simple reports (e.g., number of requests per month).
        *   **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for your resources using Laravel Sanctum for authentication.
        *   **Automated Testing:** Learn to write unit and feature tests with PHPUnit/PEST.
