I'm continuing development of the Ghodo School Admin Panel, a Laravel 12 application with Arabic RTL interface using AdminLTE. The project follows the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) in the docs/ghodo-school-srs.md file, which contains a detailed roadmap with tasks marked with ✅ when completed.

Please:

1. Review the .cursorrc file to understand project-specific configurations and guidelines
2. Examine the SRS document to determine current progress (which tasks have ✅) and identify the next uncompleted tasks
3. Provide a plan to implement the next logical task including:
   - Required files to create/modify
   - Key Laravel concepts involved
   - Any potential challenges to watch for
4. Share the appropriate Cursor AI prompt from the SRS for this task
5. Help me implement the feature with proper Arabic RTL support

Focus on quality implementation following Laravel best practices, the .cursorrc configuration guidelines, and the educational goals outlined in the SRS.
